# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. It allows a human player to play against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.

## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) in empty squares. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Features
